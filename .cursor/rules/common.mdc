# Common Rules

## Development Server

- **NEVER** attempt to run the development server
- **NEVER** use commands like `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, `pnpm dev`, or similar
- **NEVER** suggest starting the development server
- If asked about running the app, explain that you cannot start the dev server

## Browser Operations

- **NEVER** attempt to open the browser
- **NEVER** use commands like `open`, `start`, or browser-specific commands
- **NEVER** suggest opening URLs in the browser
- If asked about viewing the app in browser, explain that you cannot open browsers

## Linting and Code Quality

- When running lint commands (e.g., `npm run lint`, `eslint`, etc.):
  - **IGNORE** errors and warnings in files not related to the current task
  - Focus only on issues in files being actively worked on
  - Do not attempt to fix linting issues in unrelated files
  - If linting reveals issues in other files, mention them but do not attempt to fix them unless specifically requested

## Coding Standards

- Use '??' instead of '||' for nullish coalescing
- Never use 'any' type - always use proper types or unions

## General Guidelines

- Always focus on the specific task at hand
- Do not perform actions that could interfere with the development environment
- Prioritize code quality and correctness in the files being modified
- Provide helpful guidance without making unnecessary system changes
